# Flood_Alarming_Using_Contour_Analysis
Final year project

This project is my final year project. 

The purpose of this project is based on the incident happened in chiplun, Flood incident in July 2021. So, the purpose is to know the flood or rainfall data.

The data which I used for this project is from the government website to predict the overall rainfall in India and Madhya-Maharashtra. And also created Manually a new day-wise data from the website like government website and some climate related website.

Flood Alarming using Machine Learning, In this project used machine learning algorithms like Linear Regression and Logistic Regression and added previous year data to get the specific Data Visualization. 

Data of overall India and Madhya-Maharashtra is used and achieved an accurate prediction using MLP which is 99% for rainfall. 

Created a new day-wise data for specific Madhya-Maharashtra and applied Machine Learning Algorithm for Day-Wise prediction. 

Created a Web App using Html, CSS, Bootstrap, and Flask
